## 2. Product Overview

The DiscountMate project seeks to empower consumers with the ability to make their lives easier by providing reliable information regarding discounted items of interests from various supermarket chains, affording them the opportunity to save potentially hundreds of dollars off their weekly grocery shopping with minimal effort.
Item information is updated regularly through data collection techniques such as web-scraping, prices are then compared between various providers for the same item and those with the highest potential for savings are presented to consumers.

Additionally, the project aims to employ machine learning and data analysis techniques to identify patterns and predict future discount opportunities, providing consumers with relevant recommendations according to their interests and purchase history.
History is obtained through user interaction methods such as item searches, checking off items on a shopping list to indicate a purchase, and scanning purchase receipts by utilizing optical character recognition (OCR) technology and extracting necessary data.

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The DiscountMate project is a new, self-contained product designed to help consumers save money on their grocery shopping by providing them with reliable information on discounted items from various supermarket chains.
